    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This quick and easy curry has such great depth of flavour - it tastes like it's been cooked for hours. It's healthy too, as well as being low in fat and calories.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 red or green chilli, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>10g piece of ginger, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 Â½ tbsp tikka masala curry paste</li>
        <li>400g can cooked green lentils</li>
        <li>220ml light coconut milk</li>
        <li>200g frozen peas</li>
        <li>10g coriander, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>200g cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>4 tbsp light coconut or natural yogurt, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the onion, garlic, chilli, carrot and ginger in a food processor and blitz to a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat and cook the veg paste for 4-5 mins until fragrant and starting to soften. Add the curry paste and cook for 1 min more, then add the lentils and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour in the coconut milk and 150ml water, and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 10 mins until thickened and creamy. Add the peas in the final 5 mins, and season well.</li>
        <li>Stir in most of the coriander, then divide the curry between four bowls along with the rice. Sprinkle over the remaining coriander and top with the yogurt to serve.</li>
    </ol>
